name: T2-Modulith (Standard Scenario with JMeter - 1 user, 3 products, 30 sec think times)
author: David Kopp
description: Measure the energy consumption of a standard use case scenario of the T2-Project application in the monolithic implementation. One user checks out the inventory, thinks for 30 sec, adds a random product to cart, thinks again, add a second product, thinks again, add a third product, and finally confirms the order.
